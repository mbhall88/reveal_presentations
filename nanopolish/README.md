# [GO TO PRESENTATION](https://mbhall88.github.io/reveal_presentations/nanopolish/nanopolish.html)

This is a presentation I put together for a group meeting.  
I have recently read through a bunch of [blog posts](https://simpsonlab.github.io/blog/) 
and papers from 
Jared Simpson about [`nanopolish`](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish). 
As there is no single methods 
paper for the program I did this presentation as an exercise in 
helping me to get my head around it.  
If you want more details than you can see my full notes [here](https://github.com/mbhall88/reveal_presentations/tree/gh-pages/nanopolish/nanopolish_notes.html).
